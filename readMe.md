##Background Story
I was asked to do this as part of an assessment by a potential employer to gauge my competency with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, and databases. I'd never made a phone boook app before, but I knocked this out over the weekend, giving it about 6-8 hours in total.

## What It Does
They requrested a phonebook application that allows a user to enter the first name, last name, and phone number of a contact in a form field, and then stores that information in a database, before updating your list of current contacts--where the user has the ability to delete their contacts. So it does that, and also adds Bart Simpson as your first contact.
