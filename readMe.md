##Background Story
I was asked to do this as part of an assessment by a potential employer to gauge my competency with PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, AJAX, and databases. I'd never made a phonebook app before, but I knocked this out over the weekend, giving it about 6-8 hours in total.

## What It Does
They requested a phonebook application that allows a user to enter a contact's first name, last name, and phone number in a form field, and then stores that information in a database, before updating the user's contact list--where the user has the ability to delete their contacts. So it does that, and also adds Bart Simpson as your first contact.
